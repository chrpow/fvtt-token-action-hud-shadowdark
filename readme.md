# Token Action HUD Shadowdark

If you like Token Action HUD Shadowdark, consider supporting me by purchasing one of my [Shadowdark products](https://lettersfromthedark.com/).

Token Action HUD Shadowdark is a repositionable HUD of actions for a selected token.

This is an add-on module to [Larkinabout's Token Action HUD Core](https://github.com/Larkinabout/fvtt-token-action-hud-core/). 

# Current Features
- Make rolls directly from the HUD instead of opening your character sheet.
- Move the HUD and choose to expand the menus up or down.
- Unlock the HUD to customise layout and groups per user, and actions per actor.
- Add your own macros, journal entries and roll table compendiums.

# Help Wanted
- If you speak German, Finnish, French, Korean, or Swedish, I'd love if you could help localize the module. Just pick the appropriate .json file in the "languages" folder and provide a localization of the English string. Please double-check your terminology with the official Shadowdark FVTT localization at https://crowdin.com/project/foundryvtt-shadowdark
